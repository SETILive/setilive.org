    description : "This is vertical (constant frequency) meaning there is little or no Doppler shift change over time, and so is probably terrestrial RFI. It also has evenly spaced parallel shadows on either side of the main signal which means they are part of the main signal and not from a separate source. Note that the signal is very narrow  meaning it is a very pure frequency source and it also doesn't wander from side to side very much, so the source has very tight frequency control with little noise."

    description : "This is what two GPS satellite signals might look like. The width of each of the bright bands is about 50 Hz, which is expected for a GPS satellite signal where the otherwise pure frequency is spread by the 50 bits per second information that is modulating it. The two bright bands have slightly different slopes meaning their doppler is changing at different rates and so must be from different sources. This happens because one satellite is further up from the horizon than the other. The higher up in the sky a satellite gets, the more slowly its Doppler shift changes."

    description : "Here's a signal that definitely has some slope so the Doppler shift is changing, and also wanders a little bit in frequency making a small wiggle. The wandering could be due to normal random fluctuations in the electronics that control the source's frequency. If the wandering is small and has a pattern rather than being random, this could be due to the satellite spinning about it's antenna axis, which is sometimes done intentionally for stabilization and for other reasons. Satellites sometimes fail and the spinning can be more like tumbling, making for severe, random wandering. This is an example of an interesting signal that could trigger the ATA to take another look if it only shows up in one beam. It is pretty narrow and wanders only slightly."

    description : "Here the frequency is wandering more severely and the signal is not as narrow, meaning it is noisier. The wandering might have a slow back and forth pattern to it and so could be from a spinning satellite."

    description : "This sort of looks like spaghetti. It is basically several different sources and each one is producing a set of signals with the same wandering pattern. Actually, if an E.T. signal were also present, it shouldn't be too hard to see because it would be the only straight line in the image."

    description : "Here's an example of a signal that changes from continuous ('CW' or Continuous Wave) in the beginning (bottom part) to pulsed, turning on and off at a later time. Notice that the background gets a little bit brighter when the signal turns off. This is because of the way we produce these images. With the strong signal present, the background is pushed down in intensity, but when the strong signal goes away, background intensity comes up."
