    description : "Here's a signal that definitely has some slope so the Doppler shift is changing, and also wanders a little bit in frequency making a small wiggle. The wandering could
be due to normal random fluctuations in the electronics that control the source's frequency. If the wandering is small and has a pattern rather than being random,
this could be due to the satellite spinning about it's antenna axis, which is sometimes done intentionally for stabilization and for other reasons. Satellites sometimes
fail and the spinning can be more like tumbling, making for severe, random wandering. This is an example of an interesting signal that could trigger the ATA to take
another look if it only shows up in one beam. It is pretty narrow and wanders only slightly. We expect that ET signals won't be this bright, so keep an eye out for the
weak signals, too!"
    rolloverDescription: "You mark this with a line that seems to line up with the basic average angle so that the signal wanders to one side of the line about the same amount as does the
other side. It varies in brightness somewhat but is still pretty much unbroken, so describe this as “Continuous” and “Narrow”"

    description : "This is vertical (constant frequency) meaning there is little or no Doppler shift change over time, and so is probably terrestrial RFI. It also has parallel shadows (at
the same angle) on either side of the main signal which means they are part of the main signal and not from a separate source. These weak shadows are often
evenly spaced (but not always) and are called “sidebands”. Note that the signal is very narrow meaning it is a very pure frequency source and it also doesn't
wander from side to side very much, so the source has very tight frequency control with little noise."
    rolloverDescription: "When there's a group of signals with the same angle like this whether it's vertical or not, and there's an obvious bright one, just mark that one and ignore all of the
weak signals of the group. The bright main signal looks like it changes in strength pretty suddenly at times so you might want to describe it as “Broken” but it
seems to be there at some strength almost all the time so really isn't pulsed. It's a judgment call, but it's best to describe this one as “Parallel” rather than broken.
You would also describe it as “Narrow”"

    description : "Here's an example of a signal that changes from continuous ('CW' or Continuous Wave) in the beginning (bottom part) to pulsed, turning on and off at a later time.
Notice that the background gets a little bit brighter when the signal turns off. This is because of the way we produce these images. With the strong signal present,
the background is pushed down in intensity, but when the strong signal goes away, background intensity comes up. Also notice, like the previous example, there
are a bunch of weak shadow signals that are at the same angle as the bright one. However, they don't pulse in the same way. Shadow signals will match the angle,
but don't always match the main signal's pattern so they are very likely from the same source"
    rolloverDescription: "Like the previous example, you only need to mark the one obvious bright line of the group. This one should be labeled “Broken” even though it's also got “Parallel”
shadows. It's more important to know that the main signal is definitely pulsed, clearly turning on and off. Although this is a bit wider than a lot of the narrow signals
you see, you'd still label it as “Narrow”. This could become a judgment call in some cases. Just use your best quick judgment as to whether wide or narrow
describes it best."

    description : "Here's an example that's similar to the previous one with the shadows. Again, there are several lines that form a group that are at the same angle (also vertical in
this case), but there's not one obvious bright one. Also, these signals look broken, but still follow lines. This looks like a weak pulsed signal and maybe there is a
much brighter line like the previous example, but it's not in view, so we're just seeing the shadows."
    rolloverDescription: "In cases like this, since there' s not a single bright line to mark like the previous example, just pick any one line out of the group that have the same angle and mark
it. You might see another group of lines in the image that are at a different angle, so you would also mark one of those. When we combine your markings with other
people's, the random choices will tell us that there isn't one strong line. these lines are clearly turning on and off so describe it as “Broken” and “Narrow”. Like the
previous example, it's more important to know it's pulsed (“Broken”) than that there are parallel shadows."

    description : "This is what two GPS satellite signals might look like. The width of each of the bright bands is about 50 Hz, which is expected for a GPS satellite signal where the
otherwise pure frequency is spread by the 50 bits per second information that is modulating it. The two bright bands have slightly different slopes meaning their
doppler is changing at different rates and so must be from different sources. This happens because one satellite is further up from the horizon than the other. The
higher up in the sky a satellite gets, the more slowly its Doppler shift changes."
    rolloverDescription: "You should mark both of these signals separately because they have slightly different slopes. They are pretty wide, but not really erratic. Just place the line at
about the middle. Both mostly stay the same general brightness so describe both as “Continuous” but also select “Wide”. Just like the shadows of the previous
narrow signal examples don't worry about those weak wide shadows you see."

    description : "Here the frequency is wandering more severely and the signal is not as narrow, meaning it is noisier. The wandering might have a slow back and forth pattern to it
and so could be from a spinning satellite."
    rolloverDescription: "Like the gently wandering signal earlier, place the line at about the middle of the side to side wandering so it wanders on either side by about the same amount.
This will represent the average path of the signal. Even though It fades toward the top, it's brightness changes smoothly and not suddenly up and down, so
describe it as “Continuous”, not broken and because it wanders quite a bit, also select “Erratic”."

    description : "This sort of looks like spaghetti. It is basically several different sources and each one is producing a set of signals with the same wandering pattern. Actually, if an
E.T. signal were also present, it shouldn't be too hard to see because it would be the only straight line in the image."
    rolloverDescription: "This looks like a very difficult one to mark, but you can follow the previous guidelines and break this down rather quickly. There are a lot of ways that this could be
marked and when it's marked by people in a lot of different ways, that will be an indication of how complex the RFI is and have a pretty good idea of what's there..
Notice that there are a bunch of erratic lines that basically follow the same angle. The lonely one way over to the left actually appears to have some identical
shadows at various points to the right and there are some others that are at about the same angle. LIke previous examples of groups of parallel signals, just pick
any one that seems to be at that angle and mark it. The first marked line on the left is an example of one you might choose for that group. In the middle there
appears to be one or maybe a set of erratic lines that seem to go mostly vertical, so you could mark that with one line. To the right of that there seems to be one
erratic line that angles to the left, so that could be marked as well. Then there's a line that seems to have a steeper angle to the right than the others, so you could
mark that one. The point here is to try and pick out one to represent each angle that you see signals at. These would all be basically described as “Continuous” and
“Erratic”, although the vertical one in the center might be described as “Broken”. Some signals won't be absolutely clearly one or the other. That's not a problem.
Just use your best quick judgment. Sometimes there isn't one correct answer."
